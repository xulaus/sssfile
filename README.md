# SSSFile

The Triple S file format is format designed for the sharing of survey data between tools. It was created by the [Triple S Group](http://www.triple-s.org/) and its specification can be found on their website.

This library has been created to read Triple S format files into memory in a highly performant manner, with the lofty goal of being capable of zero copy reading and direct bindings to NumPy and Pandas while maintaining a shared library for other languages.

It is still in the early stages of development.
